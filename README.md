# transportAdsorptionFoam
A solver for species transport and surface adsorption simulations.

The surface reaction of adsorption and desorption is considered through a partially lumped dynamic Langmuir model in the boundary condition.

Sucess of the application of the model requires inverse modeling of the kinetic parameters of the adsorption.

The solver is tested on OpenFOAM-v1912
